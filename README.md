## What is this package?

**At September 17, 2020, Auth0 announced the release of new SDK,** `express-opennid-connect`,
which is _"a new Node.js SDK that makes it super easy to add OpenID Connect authentication to your Express apps"_, [Here is a link to the official announcement](https://auth0.com/blog/auth0-s-express-openid-connect-sdk/)

This package enables you to use `express-openid-connect` (hands: 'oidc') in your NestJS application. \
It supports the Auth0 OpenID Connect middleware and suggests a built in use of required scopes.


#### Whatâ€™s Going to Happen to `passport-auth0`?
According to Auth0, nothing is going to happen with it. But they DO recommend to use
`express-openid-connect` if you are creating a new project, from Auth0 official announcement:

**_We recommend considering using `express-openid-connect`, as it will be our target for all innovation for web sign-in on the Node.js platform for the foreseeable future._**
